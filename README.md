# GraphPie
Python graphing of mathematical functions, with both a GUI and CLI to a single Python OO backend


- Uses matplotlib for a zoomable and customizable graph of more than 20 mathematical functions.
- Allows multiple functions to be graphed on the same window for easy comparison.
- Cross platform compatible GUI application that works on all three major operating operating systems.
- Separation of concerns and OOP allow both interfaces to use the same backend.
